What do the .data, .word, .text directives mean (i.e. what do you use them for)?
.text: Subsequent	items	put	in	user	text	segment	(machine	code)
.data: Subsequent	items	put	in	user	data	segment	(binary	rep	of	data	in source	file)
.globl sym: declares	sym	global	and	can	be	referenced	from	other	files
.asciiz str: Store	the	string	str	in	memory	and	null-terminate	it
.word w1â€¦wn: Store the n 32-bit quantities in successive memory words

How do you set a breakpoint in MARS? Set a breakpoint on line 14 and run to it. What is the instruction address? Has line 14 executed yet?
Click on the box called Bkpt at the front of each line.
0x00400020

Once at a breakpoint, how do you continue to execute your code? How do you step through your code? Run the code to completion.
f7
Keep f7 or use f5

Find the "Run I/O" window. What number did the program output? If 0 is the 0th fib number, which fib number is this?
34
9th fib number

At what address is n stored in memory? Try finding this by (1) looking at the Data Segment and (2) looking at the machine code (Code column in the Text Segment).
0x10010010

How do you view and modify the contents of a register? Reset the simulation (Run-->Reset or F12) and now calculate the 13th fib number by (1) breaking at a well-chosen spot, (2) modifying a single register, and then (3) unsetting the breakpoint.
change t3 to 13

Lines 19 and 21 use the syscall instruction. What is it and how do you use it? (Hint: look in Help)
line 19 print integer
line 21 exit
